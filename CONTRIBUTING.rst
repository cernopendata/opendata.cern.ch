Code contributions
------------------

We follow typical `GitHub flow
<https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html>`_.

1. Fork this repository into your personal space.
2. Start a new topical branch for any contribution.  Name it sensibly,
   say ``fix-event-display-icons``.
3. Test your branch on a local site.  If everything works as expected,
   please `sign your commits
   <http://invenio-software.org/wiki/Tools/Git/Workflow#R2.Remarksoncommitlogmessages>`_
   to indicate its quality.
4. Create `logically separate commits for logically separate things
   <http://invenio-software.org/wiki/Tools/Git/Workflow#R1.Remarksoncommithistory>`_.
   Check out our usual `development practices
   <http://invenio-software.org/wiki/Development/Contributing>`_.
5. Please add any ``(closes #123)`` directives in your commit log
   message if your pull request closes an open issue.
6. Issue a pull request.  If the branch is not quite ready yet, please
   indicate ``WIP`` (=work in progress) in the pull request title.

For more information on how we work with branches, see our `developing
guide <DEVELOPING.rst>`_.
