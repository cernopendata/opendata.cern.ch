        <h1>CERN Open Data Portal</h1>
        <p>The CERN Open Data portal is the access point to a growing range
        of data produced through the research performed at CERN. It disseminates the preserved
        output from various research activities, including accompanying software and
        documentation which is needed to understand and analyse the data being shared.</p>
        <p>The portal adheres to established global standards in data
        preservation and Open Science: the products are shared under open licenses; they
        are issued with a digital object identifier (DOI) to make them citable objects in
        the scientific discourse (see details below on how to do this).</p>

                Study Group (2009)</a>). The Open Data portal focuses on the release of

                <li>Level 1 data comprises data that is directly related to publications which

            <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">All four LHC experiments have approved data
            preservation and access policies which state that they will make their data
            (except level 4 data) available. New data will enter the portal once the
            embargo periods for them are over. For detailed information regarding
            embargo periods, accessibility and preservation of LHC data, please refer
            to the experiments data policies.

            publishes and preserves data from level 2 and 3, such as simplified formats

            How to re-use and cite these datasets
        </h3>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">All datasets and other material available in this
            portal are minted with a persistent identifier, a so called DOI (Digital
            Object Identifier) that allows permanent linking to the records. The CERN
            Open Data Portal endorses the <a href="http://www.force11.org/datacitation">
                FORCE 11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation </a>
            Principles. Thus, we ask you to cite the data provided in the portal when
            you re-use them. To make this easier for you, we provide you with a citation
            recommendation for every dataset as well as output formats (e.g. BibTex)
            for common reference programs. Citing datasets in the reference list of
            your paper will allow other platforms such as INSPIRE to track citations to
            these datasets and measure their impact.</p>

            <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">Invenio is a free software suite enabling you to run your own digital library or
            document repository on the web. The technology offered by the software covers all aspects of digital library
            management, from document ingestion through classification, indexing, and curation up to document dissemination.
            Invenio complies with standards such as the Open Archives Initiative and uses MARC 21 as its underlying
            bibliographic format. The flexibility and performance of Invenio make it a comprehensive solution for management
            of document repositories of moderate to large sizes.</p>

            Compute Engine), independently of Operating System software and hardware platform (Linux, Windows, MacOS). The
            goal is to remove a need for the installation of the experiment software and to minimise the number of platforms
