    About LHCb experiment
  </h2>
  <p>The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is not only a tool with which to search for exotic new particles, but also a
    factory of particles whose existence is in no doubt but whose precise properties are not yet known well enough.
    LHCb, unlike the other experiments ATLAS and CMS, which search for new particles produced directly in the
    proton–proton collisions, is devoted to the study of well established particles, the beauty (B) and charmed (C)
    mesons. These particles, which comprise a bottom or charm quark or antiquark plus one other quark with a
    different “flavour”, only exist for about a trillionth of a second before decaying into lighter particles. But
    subtle quantum effects called loops, in which virtual particles are temporarily created by borrowing energy from
    the vacuum, can influence the behaviour of B and C mesons and give researchers a handle on particles that are
    too heavy to be produced directly.

      <p>The following datasets for educational purposes obtained from LHCb data are provided through this portal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Event display datasets, containing events where a D0 meson decays into a Kaon and a Pion. These datasets can
          be displayed with LHCb simplified event display.
        </li>
        <li>About 60k events where a D0 meson decays into a Kaon and a Pion. This dataset can be used to study signal
          and background distributions of variables characterizing the D0 decay and to measure the D0 lifetime.

      <p><strong>Physics Masterclasses: </strong>LHCb is part of the International Masterclass Programme: each year,
        high-school
        students reach their nearby universities and become LHCb physicists for a day. Their goal is to select in real
        LHCb events a particular decay of the D0 meson, where a Kaon and a Pion are produced. On such events, the D0
        lifetime is measured.
