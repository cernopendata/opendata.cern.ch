    About CMS
  </h1>
  <p>The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Experiment is one of the large particle detectors at CERN's Large
    Hadron Collider. The CMS Collaboration consists of more than 3000 scientists, engineers, technicians and students
    from 180+ institutes and universities from 40+ countries. You can find more information about the CMS
    <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/cms-detector-design">detector design</a> and

        <li>Collision data in the primary datasets are in a format known as AOD or Analysis Object Data, while simulated
          data are in a format called AODSIM.
        </li>
        <li>AOD/AODSIM files contain the information that is needed for analysis:
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>all the high-level <a>physics objects</a> (such as muons,

              <li>tracks with associated hits, calorimetric clusters with associated hits, vertices; and</li>
              <li>information about event selection (triggers), data needed for further selection and identification
                criteria for the physics objects.

            </ul>

              <li>It contains several instances of the same physics object (i.e. a jet reconstructed with different
                algorithms).
              </li>
              <li>It may have double-counting (i.e. a physics object may appear as a single object of its own type, but
                it may also be part of a jet).
              </li>
              <li>Additional knowledge is needed to define a "good" physics object.</li>

          as simple data tables.

        <li>Only the runs that are validated by data quality monitoring should be used in any analysis. The <a>list of

        <li>Despite being processed, the high-level primary datasets remain complex and selection criteria need to be

          simulated data. However, this is not a full set of simulations, but only those datasets that have been
          reprocessed with a software release compatible with the 2011 collision data.
