    About ATLAS
  </h2>
  <p>ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) is one of the two general-purpose detectors at the LHC, the other being CMS.
    Both detectors are geared towards covering a large range of physics produced in proton collisions such as the
    search for the Higgs Boson or Vector Boson Scattering.

    <div class="card-body">
      <p>The available dataset is derived from actual data
        recored by ATLAS during the 2011 run. There are 6 packages
        of 1000 events each totalling 6000 events. These events have
        been preselected to provide a high amount of interesting
        physics events. The data are saved in an XML format that can be
        read with the event display program MINERVA. A python-based
        framework for the analysis of the data is in the works.</p>
      <p> The dataset from the ATLAS Higgs Machine Learning
        Challenge is also available. The Challenge, which ran from
        May to September 2014, was to develop an algorithm that
        improved the detection of the Higgs boson signal.
        Participants applied and developed cutting-edge Machine
        Learning techniques, which have been shown to be better than
        existing traditional high-energy physics tools. The dataset
        that was available to Challenge participants through the
        Kaggle platform is now available on the CERN Open Data
        Portal to allow further studies.</p>
