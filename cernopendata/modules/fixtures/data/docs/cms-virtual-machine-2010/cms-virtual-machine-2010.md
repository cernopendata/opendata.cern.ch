The CMS-specific VM includes the [ROOT framework](http://root.cern.ch/) and [CMSSW](http://cms-sw.github.io/). Follow the instructions below to setup a CERN Virtual Machine on your computer for 2010 CMS Open Data. Then, go to [Getting Started with CMS data](/docs/cms-getting-started-2010)

## <a name="install2010"></a>How to install a CERN Virtual Machine

### Step 1: Installing VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a free, open source and multiplatform application to run virtual machines: you can [download](https://www.VirtualBox.org/wiki/Downloads) the package for your platform from the Downloads page.

You will need administrative ("root") privileges on every platform to perform the installation of VirtualBox.

Note: the latest tested version of VirtualBox working with this CMS-specific CernVM image is 5.2.2\. If you have troubles with the latest version of VirtualBox, pick that one: the full history of VirtualBox versions is available [on a different page.](https://www.VirtualBox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds)

### Step 2: Downloading and Creating a Virtual Machine

**Important**: Before you download the CernVM, note that the imported settings may not always work on your host machine. Please see [Issues and Limitations](#issues2010) if you encounter any problems with booting the VM.

Next download the CMS-specific CernVM image as OVA file from: [CMS VM Image for 2010 CMS Open Data](/record/250).

By double clicking the downloaded file, VirtualBox imports the image with ready-to-run settings: in case of any problems with booting with these default settings, see [Issues and Limitations](#issues2010). Then, you launch the CMS-specific CernVM, which boots into the graphical user interface and sets up the CMS environment.

## <a name="testvalidate2010"></a>How to Test & Validate?

The validation procedure tests that the CMS environment is installed and operational on your virtual machine, and that you have access to the ROOT files. You may skip this step if you want, and head straight to [Getting Started with CMS data](/docs/cms-getting-started-2010). However, these steps give you a quick introduction to the CMS environment.

### Set up the CMS environment and run a demo analyzer

Open a terminal with the X terminal emulator (an icon bottom-left of the VM screen).

Execute the following command; this command builds the local release area (the directory structure) for [CMSSW](/glossary/CMSSW), and only needs to be run once:

```shell
cmsrel CMSSW_4_2_8
```

Change to the <kbd>CMSSW_4_2_8/src/</kbd> directory:

```shell
cd CMSSW_4_2_8/src/
```

Then, run the following command to create the CMS runtime variables:

```shell
cmsenv
```

Create a working directory for the demo analyzer, change to that directory and create a "skeleton" for the analyzer:

```shell
mkdir Demo
cd Demo
mkedanlzr DemoAnalyzer
```

Compile the code:

```shell
cd DemoAnalyzer
scram b
```

Change the file name in the configuration file <kbd>demoanalyzer_cfg.py</kbd> in the DemoAnalyzer directory: i.e. replace <kbd>file:myfile.root</kbd> with <kbd>root://eospublic.cern.ch//eos/opendata/cms/Run2010B/Mu/AOD/Apr21ReReco-v1/0000/00459D48-EB70-E011-AF09-90E6BA19A252.root</kbd>

Change the max number of events to 10 (i.e change -1 to 10 in <kbd>process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet( input = cms.untracked.int32(-1)</kbd>).

Move two directories back using:

```shell
cd ../..
```

And then run:

```shell
cmsRun Demo/DemoAnalyzer/demoanalyzer_cfg.py
```

You can consider your VM "validated" — i.e it gets access to and compiles the CMS software, and reads the CMS open data files — if you get an output like:

## <a name="issues2010"></a>Known Issues & Limitations

### Validation report

The CMS-specific CERN Virtual Machine has been tested on several operating systems, VM softwares and hardware configurations. However, we cannot guarantee that it will work under all conditions. Problems can often be traced to a user’s particular system settings.

Solutions to some of the common problems encountered are listed below. [This validation report](/VM/CMS/validation/report) contains more information, including a full list of tested machines and configurations, along with issues faced during testing.

### Known Issues FAQ

**Q:** The following error message appears when the Virtual Machine is started: "Could not start the machine CMS Open Data because the following physical network interfaces were not found: vboxnet0 (adapter 2). You can either change the machine's network settings or stop the machine."

**A:** Change the Network settings for adapter 2 from "Host-only Adapter" to "NAT". The VM should then start correctly.

**Q:** On Ubuntu running the latest version of VirtualBox, an error appears when opening the CMS-specific virtual machine: the message is about a missing path to a definition file.

**A:** To fix this, open one of the (non-CMS-specific) CernVMs first, after which the CMS-specific one should load without the error message.

**Q:** On Windows 7 and 8, this error message appears: "VT-X/AMD-V hardware acceleration is not available on your system. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-but CPU and will not be able to boot."

**A:** Check whether your processor supports the VT-X feature by going to [http://ark.intel.com/](http://ark.intel.com/): Intel® Virtualisation Technology (VT-x) should be checked as "yes". Then, when the host machine is booting (just after switching it on) press the appropriate function key to get to the setup, go to advanced settings, and enable the virtualisation extensions of the CPU. Note that some recent Acer Inspire laptop models do not give access to the VT-X feature in the BIOS setup even if the processor supports it.

**Q:** The VM does not inherit the keyboard layout of the host machine.

**A:** The layout can be changed by using setxkbmap from a terminal inside the Virtual Machine. For example a user with a Swiss keyboard with French variant would type <kbd>setxkbmap 'ch(fr)'</kbd> in the terminal and a user with a Finnish keyboard would type <kbd>setxkbmap fi</kbd>. This can also be solved by using the GUI, which can be launched either from the graphical menu in the lower left corner (Preferences → Keyboard) or by typing in the console: xfce4-keyboard-settings. In the Layout tab it is possible to change the keyboard model and the layout. If you wish to keep these settings after reboot, you should delete all the other layouts from the menu.

**Q:** The default terminal does not accept (not even from the clipboard) nor display certain language-specific characters such as [umlauts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_%28diacritic%29).

**A:** Using a terminal such as xterm will allow reading and writing special characters.

**Q:** Users who use high resolutions on small displays and have set their host machines DPI manually, for example through <kbd>.Xresources</kbd> on Linux (X11), may find that everything is too small to be read efficiently. (Also helpful to users who have difficulties in reading the fonts and other visual information on the image due to the size of the graphical components.)

**A:** The DPI can easily be adjusted from Xfce menu → Preferences → Appearance → Fonts → DPI. This enhances the readability and general usability significantly.

**Q:** Resizing the VM window doesn't resize its contents.

**A:** This appears to only occur when a new VM image is launched for the first time. The contents should resize after several minutes (up to half an hour), and the problem should not manifest when the VM image is opened a second time.
