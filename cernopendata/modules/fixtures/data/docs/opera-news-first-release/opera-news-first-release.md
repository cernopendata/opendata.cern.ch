As of today, the OPERA Collaboration has released the first set of its data samples for the Open Data Portal.

The OPERA experiment has been searching for neutrino oscillations, i.e. the transmutation of muon neutrinos into tau neutrinos along their flight from CERN to the INFN Gran Sasso laboratory (Italy) where they are caught. The Collaboration has reported today the final results on its full data sample and the finding of ten tau neutrino candidates: with this data sample the transmutation was unambiguously proven and the tau neutrino properties were measured for the first time with a negligible background contamination. While searching for tau neutrinos, the Collaboration has also deeply studied the interactions of muon neutrinos.

The data set released today by the OPERA Collaboration contain the [multiplicity studies electronic detector and emulsion data](/search?page=1&size=20&q=multiplicity&experiment=OPERA&file_type=zip) used for a study of the muon neutrino interactions with a sub-sample of data where all the tracks produced by the interactions of neutrinos with the lead target have been studied and classified, and [tau neutrino candidate electronic detector and emulsion data](/search?page=1&size=20&q=tau&experiment=OPERA&file_type=zip).
