      "description": "The dataset was extracted from the official OPERA data repository. It contains 817 muon neutrino interactions with the lead target where a muon was reconstructed in the final state. This happens in the so-called charged-current interactions of a muon neutrino. For this data sample, the Collaboration performed a dedicated analysis, with a detailed classification of all particles produced at the neutrino interaction on top of the muon. Indeed, in a muon neutrino interaction with the nucleons of the lead target, different hadrons are produced: the so-called shower hadrons and nuclear fragments produced in the break-up and in the evaporation of the target nucleus. The detailed study of the multiplicity of the hadrons produced provides insights on the mechanism of the hadronic shower formation.  This data record contains the information of the neutrino interaction vertices including all the emulsion tracks produced in the interactions. The location of the neutrino interaction and the measurement of the trajectories of all the particles produced is the final step of the event analysis, after the identification of the neutrino interaction bricks done with the electronic detector data. The tracks include nuclear fragments moving both forward and backward. The available information includes minimum ionisation tracks produced in the hadronic shower, heavy ionising particles produced in the nuclear break-up and evaporation."

CS doublets were inspected by automatic optical scanning microscopes in two specialised scanning stations at the Gran Sasso INFN Laboratory in Italy and at Nagoya University in Japan. After finding a suitable pattern of tracks, the emulsion films of the identified brick were developed and their films were sent to dedicated scanning stations operating in different Institutes of the Collaboration. All the tracks found in the CS films were then followed inside the brick up to the neutrino interaction vertex. Finally, the neutrino interaction is fully reconstructed in the brick with a micrometric tri-dimensional accuracy after the analysis of a volume of 2 cm^3 surrounding the vertex. A total of 5603 fully reconstructed neutrino interactions were reconstructed in the 0mu and 1mu categories. A decay search procedure was carried out to detect the expected decay topologies of tau leptons produced in tau neutrino charged-current interactions. In this data sample, all the events show this decay topology. Finally, a kinematical analysis was performed to further reduce the background processes. As a result of this complex analysis chain, ten tau neutrino candidates were selected and their emulsion data is reported in this data record.</p>  "

The pattern of tracks reconstructed in the CS doublets was used to either confirm the prediction of the electronic detectors or to trigger the extraction of neighbouring bricks. CS doublets were inspected by automatic optical scanning microscopes in two specialised scanning stations at the Gran Sasso INFN Laboratory in Italy and at Nagoya University in Japan. After finding a suitable pattern of tracks, the emulsion films of the identified brick were developed and their films were sent to dedicated scanning stations operating in different Institutes of the Collaboration. All the tracks found in the CS films were then followed inside the brick up to the neutrino interaction vertex. Finally, the neutrino interaction was fully reconstructed in the brick with a micrometric tri-dimensional accuracy after the analysis of a volume of 2 cm^3 surrounding the vertex.</p><p>A decay search procedure was carried out on a total of 2925 “1mu” events and 50 events showed a charmed hadron candidate in the final state together with its subsequent decay. In this data sample,  all the events show a decay topology, with a muon attached to the primary vertex, thus discarding the tau neutrino hypothesis. They are classified as muon neutrino interaction producing a charmed hadron, which decays after a few millimeters.</p>"

      "description": "<p>This dataset was extracted from the official OPERA data repository and it contains all the emulsion data information for 19 electron neutrino candidates, identified after an extensive analysis that includes data from both electronic detectors and nuclear emulsion films after their digitization with fully automated optical microscopes.  The OPERA experiment was able to distinguish all three types of neutrinos, including electron ones. In total, 35 electron neutrino events were found in the complete data sample. Here a subsample of 19 electron neutrino interactions is reported.</p><p>This data record contains in particular the information of the neutrino interaction vertices including all the emulsion tracks produced in the observed interactions. The location of the neutrino interaction and the measurement of the trajectories of all the particles produced is the final step of the event analysis, after the identification of the neutrino interaction bricks done with the electronic detector data. The tracks produced by the electromagnetic shower induced by the electron at the primary vertex are also shown.</p>"

      "description": "<p>Events stored in this dataset were collected between 2008 and 2012. Events are classified as “1mu” if one track is tagged as a muon after the analysis of the electronic detectors data, “0mu” otherwise. In this sample only “0mu” events were selected since electron neutrino interactions do not produce any muon in the final state.</p><p>After the analysis of the electronic detector data, the selected brick was extracted from the detector, the so-called changeable-sheets (CS) emulsion film doublets were developed in a dark room and analysed with fully automated optical microscopes in order to complete the brick identification process. The pattern of tracks reconstructed in the CS doublets was used to either confirm the prediction of the electronic detectors or to trigger the extraction of neighbouring bricks. CS doublets were inspected by automatic optical scanning microscopes in a specialised scanning station at the Gran Sasso INFN Laboratory in Italy. After finding a suitable pattern of tracks, the emulsion films of the identified brick were developed and their films were sent to dedicated scanning stations operating in different Institutes of the Collaboration. All the tracks found in the CS films were then followed inside the brick up to the neutrino interaction vertex.</p><p>The brick acted as a high sampling calorimeter with more than five active layers every radiation length (X0), over a total thickness of 10 X0. For most of electron neutrino charged-current interactions, the path of the electron in the brick was long enough for the electromagnetic (e.m.) shower to develop, thus allowing its detection and reconstruction in the emulsion films.</p><p>Detected showers were carefully inspected, by visual scan, in the first two films downstream the interaction vertex to assess whether they were produced by a single particle. Thanks to the high granularity of the OPERA nuclear emulsions, one can recognize an electron-pair from gamma conversion when the e-pair tracks are separated by more than 1 micron. Once the origin of the e.m. shower was confirmed as due to a single charged particle, the event was classified as an electron neutrino candidate.</p><p>Within a total of 1197 fully reconstructed neutrino interactions reconstructed in the 0mu category, 35 were classified as coming from an electron neutrino. All the neutrino interactions were identified by a sequential event number. The subsample reported here includes all the 19 electron neutrino events to which an odd number was assigned.</p>"
