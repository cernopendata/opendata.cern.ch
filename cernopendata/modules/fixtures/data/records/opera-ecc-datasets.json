      "description": "The dataset was extracted from the official OPERA data repository. It contains 817 muon neutrino interactions with the lead target where a muon was reconstructed in the final state. This happens in the so-called charged-current interactions of a muon neutrino. For this data sample, the Collaboration performed a dedicated analysis, with a detailed classification of all particles produced at the neutrino interaction on top of the muon. Indeed, in a muon neutrino interaction with the nucleons of the lead target, different hadrons are produced: the so-called shower hadrons and nuclear fragments produced in the break-up and in the evaporation of the target nucleus. The detailed study of the multiplicity of the hadrons produced provides insights on the mechanism of the hadronic shower formation.  This data record contains the information of the neutrino interaction vertices including all the emulsion tracks produced in the interactions. The location of the neutrino interaction and the measurement of the trajectories of all the particles produced is the final step of the event analysis, after the identification of the neutrino interaction bricks done with the electronic detector data. The tracks include nuclear fragments moving both forward and backward. The available information includes minimum ionisation tracks produced in the hadronic shower, heavy ionising particles produced in the nuclear break-up and evaporation."

Events are classified as “1mu” if one track is tagged as a muon after the analysis of the electronic detectors data, “0mu” otherwise. In this sample “0mu” events and “1mu” events with a muon momentum lower than 15 GeV/c were selected since they are richer in terms of their possible tau neutrino content.</p><p>After the analysis of the electronic detector data, the selected brick is extracted from the detector, the so-called changeable-sheets (CS) emulsion film doublets are developed in a dark room and analysed with fully automated optical microscopes in order to complete the brick identification process. The pattern of tracks reconstructed in the CS doublets was used to either confirm the prediction of the electronic detectors or to trigger the extraction of neighbouring bricks. CS doublets were inspected by automatic optical scanning microscopes in two specialised scanning stations at the Gran Sasso INFN Laboratory in Italy and at Nagoya University in Japan. After finding a suitable pattern of tracks, the emulsion films of the identified brick were developed and their films were sent to dedicated scanning stations operating in different Institutes of the Collaboration. All the tracks found in the CS films were then followed inside the brick up to the neutrino interaction vertex. Finally, the neutrino interaction is fully reconstructed in the brick with a micrometric tri-dimensional accuracy after the analysis of a volume of 2 cm^3 surrounding the vertex. A total of 5603 fully reconstructed neutrino interactions were reconstructed in the 0mu and 1mu categories. A decay search procedure was carried out to detect the expected decay topologies of tau leptons produced in tau neutrino charged-current interactions. In this data sample, all the events show this decay topology. Finally, a kinematical analysis was performed to further reduce the background processes. As a result of this complex analysis chain, ten tau neutrino candidates were selected and their emulsion data is reported in this data record.</p>  "
