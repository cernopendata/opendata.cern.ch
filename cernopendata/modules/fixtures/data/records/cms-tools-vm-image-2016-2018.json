      "description": " <p>This virtual machine image provides CMS computing environment to be used with the CMS MiniAOD open data from 2016 - 2018. The virtual machine is based on <a href=\"https://cernvm.cern.ch/appliance/\">CernVM</a>. The image gets the CMS software (CMSSW) from <code>/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch</code> and the jobs running on the VM read the condition data from <code>/cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch</code>. Access to the data is through XRootD.</p> <p>It has a 40G virtual hard disk and a 20G cvmfs cache, which is large enough for condition data for full event range for 2016 data (see <a href=\"/docs/cms-guide-for-condition-database\">the CMS guide to the condition database</a> for further details). It has an embedded CERN CentOS (cc7) shell with the architecture compatible with the CMS software version, in which all CMS software specific commands should be executed. Additionally, it has another CERN CentOS 7 (cc7) shell, which can be used in the same session.</p>   <p>For known issues and limitations see</p>",
