      "description": "<p>This analysis extracts the mass spectrum of di-muons produced in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=7TeV data from the CMS experiment data recorded in 2012 during Run B and C. It is implemented using the <a href=\"https://julialang.org/\">Julia</a> language and can run in a Jupyter notebook. Python and C++ versions of this analysis can be found <a href=\"https://opendata.cern.ch/record/12342\">here</a>.</p><p> The spectrum is computed from the data by calculating the invariant mass of muon pairs with opposite charge. In the resulting plot, you are able to rediscover particle resonances in a wide energy range from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eta_meson\">$\\eta$ meson</a> at about 548 MeV up to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons\">Z boson</a> at about 91 GeV.</p><p>The analysis code produces a plot with the di-muon spectrum. Note that the bump at 30 GeV is not a resonance but an effect of the data taking due to the used trigger. The technical description of the dataset can be found in the respective record linked below.</p><p>The result of this analysis can be compared with <a href=\"https://cds.cern.ch/record/1456510\">an official result of the CMS collaboration using data taken in 2010</a>, see the plot below:</p><p align=\"middle\"><img src=\"http://cds.cern.ch/record/1456510/files/pictures_samples_dimuonSpectrum_40pb-1_mod-combined.png\" width=50% align=\"middle\"></p>"

It will propose to install the Jupyter software if the command is not found from your PATH:<p><code>julia start-notebook.jl</code></p></p><p>You should then select the notebook <code>DimuonSpectrumNanoAODJulia.ipynb</code> from the file list that should appears in your web browser.</p><p>If you launch Jupyter with the standard <code>jupyter-notebook</code> or <code>jupyterlab</code> command, please set before the environment variable JULIA_PROJECT to the path of the directory where you have downloaded the files and that contains the <code>Project.toml</code> file. This will ensure that the code is run with all the software dependencies at the same version as the we used to validate it.</p><p><strong>Runnning the analysis as a script or from REPL</strong></p><p>The analysis can also be run directly from Julia REPL without the Jupyter software using the code from <a href=\"https://github.com/cms-opendata-analyses/DimuonSpectrumNanoAODOutreachAnalysisJulia/blob/main/src/DimuonSpectrumNanoAODJulia.jl\">src/DimuonSpectrumNanoAODJulia.jl</a>.</p><p><code>cd src</code><br><code>julia -i --project=.. analysis.jl</code></p>"
