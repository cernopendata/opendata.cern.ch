      "description": " <p>CMS Open Data in the form of CSV files can be used in programming applications such as Jupyter notebooks, but they can also be read in and analysed with spreadsheet programs. This can be convenient in schools and in the general context of education if teachers and students are already familiar with spreadsheet programs. Note, however, that it can become cumbersome to work with large datasets in these applications. Instructions for use are provided for LibreOffice (in English and Spanish) and for Excel (in English). You can access the repository directly in <a href=\"https://github.com/cms-opendata-education/cms-spreadsheet-materials-multiple-languages/\">this Github repository</a> or download the contents from this record.</p> "
