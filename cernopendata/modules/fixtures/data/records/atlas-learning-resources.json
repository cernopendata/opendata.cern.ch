      "description": "The ATLAS Physics Masterclasses are an outreach programme of the ATLAS collaboration. It illustrates the basic principles of data analysis using actual data taken by the ATLAS detector in 2011. The linked page makes two measurements available: the W path and the Z path.\n       In both paths the user will learn about recognising and identifying particles by examining detector signatures. The W path measurement aims at understanding the structure of the proton as well as searching for the Higgs. The Z path teaches about searches for new particles. Here the use will also hunt for the Higgs but also for the Z and a hypothetical particle, the Z'. "
