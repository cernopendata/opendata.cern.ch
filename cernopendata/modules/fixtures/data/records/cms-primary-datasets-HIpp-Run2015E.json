Certification is based first on the offline shifters evaluation and later on the feedback provided by detector and Physics Object Group experts. Based on the above information, which is stored in a specific database called Run Registry, the Data Quality Monitoring group verifies the consistency of the certification and prepares a json file of certified runs to be used for physics analysis. For each reprocessing of the raw data, the above mentioned steps are repeated. For more information see:",
