      "description": "Every year, in the frame of the International Masterclasses in Particle Physics, thousands of high-school students become physicists for a day: they visit a nearby institute and analyse real LHC data. ALICE participates in this very successful programme with two masterclass exercises. Using simplified software the students analyse data from heavy-ion collisions. They look for particles containing the strange quark and eventually observe strangeness enhancement; or they count charged particles calculating the nuclear modification factor, one of the observables used for the study of the Quark Gluon Plasma."
