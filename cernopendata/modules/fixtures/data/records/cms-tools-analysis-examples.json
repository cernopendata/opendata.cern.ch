    "description": " <p>The example uses legacy versions of the original CMS data sets in the CMS <a href=\"/glossary/AOD\">AOD format</a>, which slightly differ from the ones used for the publication due to improved calibrations. It also uses legacy versions of the corresponding Monte Carlo simulations, which are again close to, but not identical to, the ones in the original publication. These legacy data and MC sets listed below were used in practice, exactly as they are, in many later CMS publications.</p> <P>Since according to the CMS Open Data policy the fraction of data which are public (and used here) is only 50% of the available LHC Run I samples, the statistical significance is reduced with respect to what can be achieved with the full dataset. However, the original paper <a href=\"https://inspirehep.net/record/1124338?ln=en\">Phys.Lett. B716 (2012) 30-61, arXiv:1207.7235</a>, was also obtained with only part of the Run I statistics, roughly equivalent to the luminosity of the public set, but with only partial statistical overlap.</p> <p> The provided analysis code recodes the spirit of the original analysis and recodes many of the original cuts on original data objects, but does not provide the original analysis code itself. Also, for the sake of simplicity, it skips some of the more advanced analysis methods of the original paper. Nevertheless, it provides a qualitative insight about how the original result was obtained. In addition to the documented core results, the resulting Root files also contain many undocumented plots which grew as a side product from setting up this example and earlier examples. The significance of the Higgs 'excess' is about 2 standard deviations in this example, while it was 3.2 standard deviations in this channel alone in the original publication. The difference is attributed to the less sophisticated background suppression. In more recent (not yet public) CMS data sets with higher statistics the signal is observed in a preliminary analysis with more than 5 standard deviations in this channel alone <a href=\"https://cds.cern.ch/record/2256357?ln=en\">CMS-PAS-HIG-16-041</a>.</p> "
