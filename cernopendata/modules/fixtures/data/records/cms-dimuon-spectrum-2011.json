The most interesting histogram is <kbd>GM_mass_log</kbd>.\n      In order to compare it with the invariant-mass spectrum of di-muons in <a href=\"https://inspirehep.net/record/1118729/plots\">MUO-10-004</a>, it should be viewed with the <kbd>logy</kbd> option. With 10000 events\n      the comparison is poor, but the J/&psi; (at log10(mass)=0.5), &Upsilon; (at log10(mass=0.98))\n      and Z (at log10(mass)=1.95, one event only) peaks should be visible.</p>\n      <p>Finally, to run over more or even the full data, edit the relevant parts of the Python file <kbd>demoanalyzer_cfg.py</kbd> (see comments therein) and rerun.\n</p> "
