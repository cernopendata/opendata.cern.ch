      "description": "The dataset was extracted from the official OPERA data repository. It contains 817 muon neutrino interactions with the lead target where a muon was reconstructed in the final state. This happens in the so-called charged-current interactions of a muon neutrino. For this data sample, the Collaboration performed a dedicated analysis, with a detailed classification of all particles produced at the neutrino interaction on top of the muon. Indeed, in a muon neutrino interaction with the nucleons of the lead target, different hadrons are produced: the so-called shower hadrons and nuclear fragments produced in the break-up and in the evaporation of the target nucleus. The detailed study of the multiplicity of the hadrons produced provides insights on the mechanism of the hadronic shower formation. This data record contains all the electronic detector hits produced by the neutrino interactions in their propagation through the detector, except in the emulsion films. It includes hits in the scintillating target tracker, drift tubes and resistive plate chambers. The hits in the drift tubes and in the resistive plate chambers are used to reconstruct the muon tracks and measure its charge and momentum. The hits in the target tracker are used to predict the location of the neutrino interaction in the target units, the so-called bricks. This leads to the subsequent phase of the analysis where the neutrino interaction is located with micrometric accuracy and all tracks attached are measured."
