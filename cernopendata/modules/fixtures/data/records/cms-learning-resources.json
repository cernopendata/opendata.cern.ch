    "description": "This tutorial by Christian Sander and Alexander Schmidt gives a basic introduction to fundamental concepts of data analysis in HEP experiments, using a small sample of specially released CMS data collected in 2011. It has been used for a one-week course in the context of a HEP workshop and a data analysis school. It should be most useful for undergraduate students who have a basic knowledge of particle physics, but without any experience in data analysis. Prerequisites are some knowledge of C++ and the ROOT data analysis framework (there are dedicated tutorials on ROOT as well)."
