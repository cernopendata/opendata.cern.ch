      "description": "<p>The dataset consists of particle jets extracted from simulated proton-proton collision events at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV generated with Pythia 8. The particles emerging from the collisions traverse through a simulation of the CMS detector. The particles were reconstructed from the simulated detector signals using the particle-flow (PF) algorithm. The reconstructed particles are also called PF candidates. The jets in this dataset were clustered from the PF candidates of each collision event using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with distance parameter $R = 0.4$. The standard L1+L2+L3+residual jet energy corrections are applied to the jets and pileup contamination is mitigated using the charged hadron subtraction (CHS) algorithm.</p> <p>From each collision event, only those jets with transverse momentum exceeding 30 GeV were saved to file. The jets were also required to have pseudorapidity of less than 2.5 (this indicates the jet's position in the detector). For each jet, there are variables describing the jet on a high-level, particle-level and generator-level. There are also some variables describing the collision event and the conditions of its simulation. All of the variables are saved on a jet-by-jet basis, which means that one row of data corresponds to one jet.</p> <p>The origin of a jet is particularly interesting. This so-called flavor of the jet is obtained from the generator-level particles by a jet flavor algorithm, which attempts to match a reconstructed jet to a single initiating particle. As a consequence, the jet flavor definition depends on the chosen algorithm. Here three different flavor definitions are available. The ‘hadron’ definition identifies b- and c-hadrons from the jet’s constituents, so it is only useful for b-tagging studies. The ‘parton’ definition extends this to include the light jet flavors (u, d, s and gluon). Finally there is the ‘physics’ definition, which looks at the quarks and gluons of the initial collision. The ‘parton’ and ‘physics’ definitions both identify all jet flavors, but the former is more biased towards b- and c-quarks. If in doubt, it is recommended to use the ‘physics’ definition.</p>"

Selected features of inclusive (both charged and neutral) PF candidates with pT > 0.95 GeV associated to the AK8 jet are provided. Additional features of charged PF candidates (formed primarily by a charged particle track) with pT > 0.95 GeV associated to the AK8 jet are also provided.

      "description": "<p>This dataset consists of a collection of pixel doublet seeds, i.e. the hit pairs that could belong to the same particle flying through the CMS Silicon Pixel Detector. These can be used in ML studies of particle tracking algorithms. Particle tracking is the process of clustering the recorded hits into groups of points arranged along an helix. </p> <p> One of the first steps of the track finding workflow is the creation of track seeds, i.e. compatible pairs of hits from different detector layers, that are subsequently fed to to higher level pattern recognition steps.  The compatibility between two hits is evaluated only on the basis of geometrical considerations, such as cuts in $\\eta$, $\\phi$ and $r$, and these doublets define the building blocks for further tracks. However the set of compatible hit pairs is highly affected by combinatorial background resulting in the next steps of the tracking algorithm to process a significant fraction of fake doublets. For each event an $O(10^6)$ doublets are produced while only an $O(10^3)$ are genuine resulting in a fake ratio of $O(10^3)$. </p> <p> Each doublet in this dataset is charcaterised by a set of features, such as its coordinates and the charge released in ther Pixel Detector, and the pixel cluster shape, projected on 2D histogram. A possible way of reducing the huge combinatorial background is using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to check the compatibility between two hits. Indeed the task of fake rejection can be seen as a typical classification problem for which networks and MVA methods have been widely proven to provide reliable results. The dataset provided is intended to be used to explore this techniques. </p>"
