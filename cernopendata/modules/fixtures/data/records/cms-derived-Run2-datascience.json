      "description": "<p>The dataset consists of particle jets extracted from simulated proton-proton collision events at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV generated with Pythia 8. The particles emerging from the collisions traverse through a simulation of the CMS detector. The particles were reconstructed from the simulated detector signals using the particle-flow (PF) algorithm. The reconstructed particles are also called PF candidates. The jets in this dataset were clustered from the PF candidates of each collision event using the anti-$k_t$ algorithm with distance parameter $R = 0.4$. The standard L1+L2+L3+residual jet energy corrections are applied to the jets and pileup contamination is mitigated using the charged hadron subtraction (CHS) algorithm.</p> <p>From each collision event, only those jets with transverse momentum exceeding 30 GeV were saved to file. The jets were also required to have pseudorapidity of less than 2.5 (this indicates the jet's position in the detector). For each jet, there are variables describing the jet on a high-level, particle-level and generator-level. There are also some variables describing the collision event and the conditions of its simulation. All of the variables are saved on a jet-by-jet basis, which means that one row of data corresponds to one jet.</p> <p>The origin of a jet is particularly interesting. This so-called flavor of the jet is obtained from the generator-level particles by a jet flavor algorithm, which attempts to match a reconstructed jet to a single initiating particle. As a consequence, the jet flavor definition depends on the chosen algorithm. Here three different flavor definitions are available. The ‘hadron’ definition identifies b- and c-hadrons from the jet’s constituents, so it is only useful for b-tagging studies. The ‘parton’ definition extends this to include the light jet flavors (u, d, s and gluon). Finally there is the ‘physics’ definition, which looks at the quarks and gluons of the initial collision. The ‘parton’ and ‘physics’ definitions both identify all jet flavors, but the former is more biased towards b- and c-quarks. If in doubt, it is recommended to use the ‘physics’ definition.</p>"

Selected features of inclusive (both charged and neutral) PF candidates with pT > 0.95 GeV associated to the AK8 jet are provided. Additional features of charged PF candidates (formed primarily by a charged particle track) with pT > 0.95 GeV associated to the AK8 jet are also provided.
