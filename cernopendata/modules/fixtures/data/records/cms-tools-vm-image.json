It gets the CMS software (CMSSW) from /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch. Access to the data is through XRootD. <br/> The \"CMS-OpenData-1.1.2.ova\" version is recommended, it has an embedded slc5 shell, where all CMS software specific commands should be executed. Additionally, it has a slc7 shell, which can be used in the same session. It has a 20G virtual hard disk and a 10G cvmfs cache and can read the condition data from /cvmfs/cms-opendata-conddb.cern.ch.</p> <p>For known issues and limitations see</p>",
