<p>Starting today, the data from 100 trillion proton collisions is now public on the Open Data Portal! This marks the world's first open release of 8 TeV data, gathered from the Large Hadron Collider in 2012.</p>
<p>Given its strong emphasis on learning, the release of ATLAS Open Data is accompanied by additional resources that are available via the ATLAS educational platform. The resources guide users through the data, explain how to visualise and how to download and use the data, and even provides open-source software. As part of this, ATLAS has made seven physics analyses available for users to get started with their research. By releasing additional resources and comprehensive documentation ATLAS aims at bridging the gap between phycisists and the public.</p>
