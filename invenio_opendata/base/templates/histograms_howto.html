    This application reads in a csv file, where "csv" stands for comma-separated-variable. Files from several different datasets and event selections
    are provided. If you want to make your own csv files from the primary datasets example code can be found here: 
    <a href="https://github.com/tpmccauley/dimuon-filter">https://github.com/tpmccauley/dimuon-filter</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Whether you use one of the files provided or make one of your own, there are several ways to examine the contents and to see what the distributions
    of the parameters contained therein look like. Here are a few examples using a csv file created by selecting from the “Mu” dataset events with precisely 2 muons. 
    Each line represents the information for the 2 muons for each event.
