<h1>Introduction to particle physics through CMS data</h1>

<h2>CMS HEP Tutorial</h2>

<div class="col-md-12">
	<p>
		This tutorial gives a basic introduction into fundamental concepts of data analysis in HEP experiments. In the current format it has been used for a one-week course in the context of a HEP workshop and a data analysis school. It should be most useful for undergraduate students who have the basic knowledge of particle physics, but without any experience in data analysis. Prerequisites are some knowledge of C++ and the ROOT data analysis framework (there are dedicated tutorials on ROOT as well).

<h2>Particle Physics Playground</h2>

<div class="col-md-12">
	<p>
		This site provides exercises, mostly using real data from experiments, that teach particle physics, mostly from the experimental side. This site is not meant to be a fully comprehensive tutorial. The ideal student will have learned the basic concepts elsewhere (classroom setting, mentor, independent study) and then will use these exercises to test their understanding of the concepts and to develop some sense of how "real scientists" are doing this work in the field.

<h2>Physics Masterclasses</h2>

<div class="col-md-12">
	<p>
		Every year, thousands of high-school students all over the world become particle physicists for a day, and visit nearby CMS institutes and universities to perform real analyses using public CMS data. The CMS Masterclass exercise is developed by <a href="http://quarknet.fnal.gov/">QuarkNet</a> and conducted under the aegis of the <a href="http://cern.ch/ippog">International Particle Physics Outreach Group</a>.

<h2>CMS e-Lab</h2>

<div class="col-md-12">
	<p>
		The CMS e-Lab provides students with an opportunity to analyze data to calibrate the detector and participate in discovery science (as particle physicists do). Calibrating the detector to "rediscover" previous measured results is an important part of the early scientific activity at CMS. Later students will probe data where physicists expect to find answers to questions at the heart of 21st century particle physics.

<h2>CMS analyses with VISPA</h2>

<div class="col-md-12">
	<p>
		The Visual Physics Analysis (VISPA) project provides a graphical development environment for data analysis. It addresses the typical development cycle of re-designing, executing, and verifying an analysis.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		VISPA is being used at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, where it was developed, to teach third-year undergraduate physics students how to analyse CMS data, as part of courses on particle and astroparticle physics. Among other things, they learn how to calculate the masses of particles produced at the LHC.
