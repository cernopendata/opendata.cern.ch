	CERN Virtual Machines allow you to run Scientific Linux on any operating system and access the CERN working environments and software tools. The CMS-specific VM includes the <a href="http://root.cern.ch/">ROOT framework</a> and <a href="http://cms-sw.github.io/">CMSSW</a>. Follow the instructions below to setup a CERN Virtual Machine on your computer. Then, go to <a href="FIXME!"></a>Getting Started with CMS data</a>.

<div class="body">
	<p>VirtualBox is a free, open source and multiplatform application to run virtual machines: you can <a href="#">download</a> the package for your platform from the Downloads page.</p>
	<p>You will need administrative ("root") privileges on every platform to perform the installation of VirtualBox.</p>
	<p>Note: the latest tested version of VirtualBox working with CernVM is 4.3.14. If you have troubles with the latest verion of VirtualBox, pick that one: the full history of VirtualBox versions is available <a href="#">on a different page.</a></p>

<div class="body">
	<div class="row">
		<div class="it col-md-12"><b>A: </b>It seems that it is necessary to open one of the official Cern VMs (3?) before using the Open Data specific VM. After running the Cern VM once, also the Open Data VM works without complaints.</div>

<div class="heading"><b>Q: </b>An error message when starting the Open Data specific VM on Windows 7: VT-X/AMD-V hardware acceleration is not available on your system. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-but CPU and will not be able to boot.
I've checked from http://ark.intel.com/ that my processor should support the VT-X feature: http://ark.intel.com/products/47663/Intel-Core-i3-330M-Processor-3M-Cache-2_13-GHz (Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) checked as "yes")

	<div class="row">
		<div class="it col-md-12"><b>A: </b>The layout can be changed by using setxkbmap from a terminal. For example a user with a Swiss keyboard with French variant would type in the console: setxkbmap 'ch(fr)' and a user with a Finnish keyboard would do: setxkbmap fi.This can also be solved by using the GUI, which can be launched either from the graphical menu in the lower left corner (Preferences -> Keyboard) or by typing in the console: xfce4-keyboard-settings. In the Layout tab it’s possible to change the keyboard model and the layout. If you wish to keep these settings after reboot, you should delete all the other layouts from the menu.

<div class="heading"><b>Q: </b>This concerns users who use high resolutions on small displays and have set their host machines DPI manually, for example through .Xresources on Linux (X11). The problem is that everything is too small to be read efficiently due to DPI set incorrectly. This can also be helpful to users who have difficulties in reading the fonts and other visual information on the image due to the size of the graphical components.
