    <p>Energy and momentum were "ready-to-use". However an additional selection was needed for identification.

    <p>The collection most commonly used in 2011 data was <code>recoPhotons_photons__RECO</code> (collection of objects type <code>reco::Photon</code>).</p>
    <p>The energy and momentum were ready to use. However for photon identification additional selection needs to be applied. These cuts are listed in <a href="http://cms-physics.web.cern.ch/cms-physics/public/EGM-10-006-pas.pdf">Table 1 here [PDF]</a>.</p>
    <p>Converted photons are included in the above mentioned collection. The conversion seeded by the ECAL clusters were already attached to the photon collection and can be accessed with this information.</p>
    <p>Difference between "AllConversions" and "conversions": "AllConversions" are conversion seeded with tracking properties, while "conversions" are seeding by the ECAL clusters. The latter are very similar to the conversion also linked to the photon, it slightly differs for p<sub>T</sub> cuts.</p>
    <p>The default collection of photons has a very very loose pre-selection. Basically every energy deposit in the ECAL with E<sub>T</sub> &gt; 10 GeV and HCAL energy / ECAL energy &lt; 0.5 is reconstructed as a photon. This means that without any additional selection the background is very very large and it is not usable for any analysis.</p>

    <p>The muons most commonly used in 2011 data analysis are contained in the collection <code>recoMuons_muon__RECO</code>.</p>
    <p>This includes muons identified by the Particle-Flow algorithm as well.</p>
    <p>Most of the muon properties (e.g. momentum and isolation variables) are available in the <code>reco::Muon</code> object collection, ready to use. Some precaution in the choice of the momentum or isolation definition may be needed, depending on the analysis (see below). Some additional corrections to the muon momentum (in general very small, &lt; 1%) can be applied, and are especially recommended for precision measurements. These are provided centrally by the muon POG and are to be applied on top of the momentum stored in the <code>reco::Muon</code> object. In general, the objects in the <code>reco::Muon</code> collection cannot be used "out of the box", but some further selections are necessary. The most widely used IDs are documented in <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1712504">CMS-DP-2014-020</a>.</p>

      <div id="rm-muon" class="collapse">
        <ul class="row">
          <li>1.  The <code>reco::Muon</code> collection includes muons reconstructed by different algorithms: fit in the muon chambers alone (standalone muons), fit in the Tracker alone + matching with muon hits (Tracker muons), and combined fit of Tracker and muon hits (global muons). Not all the objects included in this collection are suitable for every analysis: e.g. it contains non-prompt muons from hadron decays or fake muons produced by random matching of hadron tracks with muon-chamber hits. Therefore further selections and identification criteria must be applied to reject fake or background muons. Five main selections are recommended for 2011 data analysis: (1) the Soft Muon selection, optimised for low-p<sub>T</sub> muons (p<sub>T</sub> &lt; ~10 GeV/c) and used in B-physics and Quarkonia analyses; (2) the Loose Muon selection, useful for analyses with multi-lepton final states where high efficiency on muons is important (H&rarr;ZZ&rarr;4l analysis, for example); (3) the Tight Muon selection, most effective in rejecting non-prompt muons from decays and used in many CMS analyses (e.g. those involving muons from W and Z); (4) the high-p<sub>T</sub> selection, similar to the Tight one, but imposing additional requirements on the quality of the measured momentum; and (5) the Particle-Flow Muon selection, which is required by the Tight and Loose identifications and which uses information from all sub-detectors to select with high efficiency isolated and non-isolated muons, while rejecting fake muons from hadron mis-identification, giving the best overall performance. An exact definition of the selections to be used for 2011 data analysis can be found in <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1712504">CMS-DP-2014-020</a>.</li>
          <li>2.  The <code>reco::Muon</code> object is recommended for all analyses involving muons with low and intermediate p<sub>T</sub> (p<sub>T</sub> &lt; ~200 GeV/c): for p<sub>T</sub> &lt; 200 GeV, this corresponds to the momentum obtained from the fit of the Tracker hits only; for p<sub>T</sub> &gt; 200 GeV/c, the default momentum is chosen between the results of the Tracker-only fit and the combined fit of Tracker and muon-chamber hits, based on the quality of the two fits. For analyses involving very-high-p<sub>T</sub> muons, subject to possible energy loss by <em>bremsstrahlung</em>, dedicated refits of the global-muon track are available: the Tracker-Plus-First-Muon-Station (TPFMS) fit, which uses the Tracker and first muon-station hits; and the Picky fit, which uses hits from the Tracker and from all the muon chambers, but selecting the muon hits with tight compatibility criteria in chambers with high hit occupancy (i.e. with possible showers). The recommended choice to optimise the momentum resolution at high p<sub>T</sub> is provided by the "Tune P" algorithm, which selects the momentum obtained from the best of three different fits: the Tracker-only, the TPFMS and the Picky fit. At times, the Particle-Flow algorithm can prefer the momentum information coming from a fit other than the inner track or the Tune-P decision. In topologies such as W/Z signals, and below 200 GeV of momentum, differences between the recommended decision and Partcle-Flow are well below 0.5%. Care should be taken in analyses relying heavily on Particle-Flow and investigating topologies very different from the ones mentioned above.</li>
          <li>3.  The isolation variables, i.e. energy or momentum deposits in cones centred around the muon track, are stored in the <code>reco::Muon</code> object, and can be used to compute different isolation definitions. The recommended ones for 2011 data analysis are the following:
            <ul class="with-circles">
              <li>Tracker relative isolation: scalar sum of the p<sub>T</sub> of all Tracker tracks reconstructed in a cone of radius ΔR = √(Δη2 + Δφ2) &lt; 0.3 centred on the muon track direction;</li>
              <li>combined relative PF isolation mitigated against pile-up using "deltaBeta" method: sum of the p<sum>T</sum> of all PF charged hadrons coming from the primary vertex + max(sum p<sum>T</sum> of neutral hadrons and photons &minus; 0.5 x sum p<sum>T</sum> of charged hadrons coming from pile-up vertices, 0). The recommended cone radius to be used to compute all the above, in case of PF isolation is ΔR = √(Δη2 + Δφ2) &lt; 0.4.</li>

    <p>(N.B.: b-jets described separately <a href="#bjet2011">below</a>)</p>
    <p>The most commonly used variants of jets and missing E<sub>T</sub> are:
      <ul>
        <li><code>recoPFJets_ak5PFJets__RECO</code> (collection of objects of type <code>reco::PFJet</code>)</li>
        <li><code>recoPFMETs_pfMet__RECO</code> (collection of objects of type <code>reco::PFMET</code>)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The jets typically require Jet Energy Correction (JEC) to be applied, and the preference for MET is to apply so-called type-I corrections, which propagate the JEC to MET. The jets should have a JEC stored, although this is often re-run for analysis with the latest version of JEC constants. The 2011 AOD should have a reasonable JEC, although there may have been slight changes to JEC in later re-reco versions that we have not propagated all the way.</p>
    <p>For most educational purposes, the PF jets and MET are ready to use after JEC and type-I, since the corrections are relatively small (typically &lt; 5% and mostly &lt; 10%) and the changes in the corrections would have been even smaller (typically &lt; 2% level). The jets are validated for corrected p<sub>T</sub>&gt;10 GeV and |&eta;|&lt;4.7 (this is used in type-I MET), but for most physics analyses we recommend corrected p<sub>T</sub>&gt;30 GeV and |&eta;|&lt;2.5, where the jet reconstruction and calibrations are the most reliable.</p>

          <li>4. For SUSY-type analysis, MET tails often come from jets (ECAL holes, heavy flavour, JER), so analyses typically apply cuts on Δφ(jet, MET) to ensure MET is not aligned with one of the jets</li>

    <p>The most commonly used tags in 2011 analyses were the Track Counting High Purity (collection: <code>trackCountingHighPurBJetTags</code>) and Track Counting High Efficiency (collection: <code>trackCountingHighEffBJetTags</code>).</p>
    <p>Also in use were the Simple Secondary Vertex High Efficiency (collection: <code>simpleSecondaryVertexHighEffBJetTags</code>) and Simple Secondary Vertex High Purity (collection: <code>simpleSecondaryVertexHighEffBJetTags</code>).</p>
    <p>Finally, later analyses on 2011 data have used the Combined Secondary Vertex (collection: <code>combinedSecondaryVertexBJetTags</code>) and maybe the Jet Probability (collection: <code>jetProbabilityBJetTags</code>) algorithms.</p>
    <p>The collections contain the discriminator values for each jets, for the respective b-tagging algorithm. In order to decide if a jet is tagged, one has to ask the discriminator value to be greater of a specific threshold.<p>We define three possible thresholds (working points) for each algorithm, which correspond to the cuts on the discriminator that allow to reduce the rate of mis-identification of light jets as b-jets to 10% (loose working point), 1% (medium working point) and 0.1% (tight working point), respectively.</p>
    <p>Monte Carlo simulation does not reproduce correctly the distributions of the b-tag discriminator observed in data. As a consequence, the efficiencies for a b-jet to be tagged (as well as the probability for a light jet to be mis-tagged) when applying a certain working point requirement is not well reproduced in MC. The BTV POG provides data-to-MC scale factors to correct the efficiencies of b-tagging (and the mis-tagging rates) predicted by the simulation.</p>
