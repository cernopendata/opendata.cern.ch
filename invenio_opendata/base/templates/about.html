          <p class="col-md-12">The CERN Open Data portal is the access point to a growing range
            of data produced through the research performed at CERN. It disseminates the preserved
            output from various research activities, including accompanying software and
            documentation which is needed to understand and analyse the data being shared.</p>
          <p class="col-md-12">The portal adheres to established global standards in data
            preservation and Open Science: the products are shared under open licenses; they
            are issued with a digital object identifier (DOI) to make them citable objects in
            the scientific discourse (see details below on how to do this).</p>

				categorised in four different levels (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0255">DPHEP
				Study Group (2009)</a>). The Open Data portal focuses on the release of
				data from level 2 and 3.</p>
              <ul class="col-md-12">
                <li>Level 1 data comprises data that is directly related to publications which
					provide documentation for the published results</li>
				<li>Level 2 data includes simplified data formats for analysis in outreach and
					training exercises</li>
				<li>Level 3 data comprises reconstructed data and simulations as well as the
					analysis level software to allow a full scientific analysis</li>
				<li>Level 4 covers basic raw level data (if not yet covered as level 3 data) and
					their associated software and allows access to the full potential of the
					experimental data</li>

              <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">All four LHC experiments have approved data
					preservation and access policies which state that they will make their data
					(except level 4 data) available. New data will enter the portal once the

			  <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">In support of these data policies, this portal

              <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">All datasets and other material available in this
					portal are minted with a persistent identifier, a so called DOI (Digital
					Object Identifier) that allows permanent linking to the records. The CERN
					Open Data Portal endorses the <a href="http://www.force11.org/datacitation">
					FORCE 11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation </a>
					Principles. Thus, we ask you to cite the data provided in the portal when
					you re-use them. To make this easier for you, we provide you with a citation
					recommendation for every dataset as well as output formats (e.g. BibTex)
					for common reference programs. Citing datasets in the reference list of
					your paper will allow other platforms such as INSPIRE to track citations to
					these datasets and measure their impact.</p>

The technology offered by the software covers all aspects of digital library management, from document ingestion through classification, indexing, and curation up to document dissemination. Invenio complies with standards such as the Open Archives Initiative and uses MARC 21 as its underlying bibliographic format. The flexibility and performance of Invenio make it a comprehensive solution for management of document repositories of moderate to large sizes.</p>

The Appliance represents a complete, portable and easy to configure user environment for developing and running LHC data analysis locally and on institutional and commercial clouds (OpenStack, Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine), independently of Operating System software and hardware platform (Linux, Windows, MacOS). The goal is to remove a need for the installation of the experiment software and to minimise the number of platforms (compiler-OS combinations) on which experiment software needs to be supported and tested.</p>
