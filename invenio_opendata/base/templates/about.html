          <p class="col-md-12">The CERN Open Data portal is the access point to a growing range 
            of data produced through the research performed at CERN. It disseminates the preserved 
            output from various research activities, including accompanying software and 
            documentation which is needed to understand and analyze the data being shared.</p>
          <p class="col-md-12">The portal adheres to established global standards in data 
            preservation and Open Science: the products are shared under open licenses; they 
            are issued with a digital object identifier (DOI) to make them citable objects in 
            the scientific discourse (see details below on how to do this).</p>

              <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">Data produced by the LHC experiments are usually 
				categorized in four different levels (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0255">DPHEP 
				Study Group (2009)</a>). The Open Data portal focuses on the release of 
				data from levels 2 and 3.</p>
              <ul class="col-md-12">
                <li>Level 1 data comprises data that is directly related to publications which 
					provide documentation for the published results</li>
				<li>Level 2 data includes simplified data formats for analysis in outreach and 
					training exercises</li>
				<li>Level 3 data comprises reconstucted data and simulations as well as the 
					analysis level software to allow a full scientific analysis</li>
				<li>Level 4 covers basic raw level data (if not yet covered as level 3 data) and 
					their associated software and allows access to the full potential of the 
					experimental data</li>

              <h2 id="tools">Data Policies</h2>
              <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">All four LHC experiments have approved data 
					preservation and access policies which state that they will make their data 
					(except level 4 data) available. New data will enter the portal once the 
					embargo periods for them are over. For detailed information regarding 
					embargo periods, accessibility and preservation of LHC data, please refer 
					to the experimentsâ€™ 
					<a href="{{ url_for('.collection', name = 'Data-Policies') }}">data policies</a>.</p>
			  <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">In support of these data policies, this portal 
					publishes and preserves data from level 2 and 3, such as simplified formats 
					and fully reconstructed events, together with associated software and 
					documentation needed to access and use the data.</p>

              <h2 id="tools">How to re-use and cite these datasets</h2>
              <p class="col-md-12 no-padding">All datasets and other material available in this 
					portal are minted with a persistent identifier, a so called DOI (Digital 
					Object Identifier) that allows permanent linking to the records. The CERN 
					Open Data Portal endorses the <a href="http://www.force11.org/datacitation">
					FORCE 11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation </a>
					Principles. Thus, we ask you to cite the data provided in the portal when 
					you re-use them. To make this easier for you, we provide you with a citation 
					recommendation for every dataset as well as output formats (e.g. BibTex) 
					for common reference programs. Citing datasets in the reference list of 
					your paper will allow other platforms such as INSPIRE to track citations to 
					these datasets and measure their impact.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

		<p class="col-md-12">The portal is a collaborative effort of the CERN groups IT-CIS 
					and GS-SIS in collaboration with the many researchers in the HEP community.</p>
