<subfield code="a">For the Challenge, we provide simulated events using the official ATLAS full detector simulator.
The simulator has two parts. In the first, random proton-proton collisions are simulated based on
all the knowledge that we have accumulated on particle physics. It reproduces the random microscopic
explosions resulting from the proton-proton collisions. In the second part, the resulting
particles are tracked through a virtual model of the detector. The process yields simulated events
with properties that mimic the statistical properties of the real events with additional information
on what has happened during the collision, before particles are measured in the detector.
The signal sample contains events in which Higgs bosons (with fixed mass 125 GeV) were
produced. The background sample was generated by other known processes which can produce
events with at least one electron or muon and a hadronic tau, mimicking the signal. For the sake
of simplicity, only three background processes were retained for the Challenge. The first comes
from the decay of the Z boson (with mass 91.2 GeV) in two taus. This decay produces events
with a topology very similar to that produced by the decay of a Higgs. The second set contains
events with a pair of top quarks, which can have lepton and hadronic tau among their decay. The
third set involves the decay of the W boson, where one electron or muon and a hadronic tau can
appear simultaneously only through imperfections of the particle identification procedure.
Due to the complexity of the simulation process, each simulated event has a weight which
is proportional to the conditional density divided by the instrumental density used by the simulator
(an importance-sampling flavor), and normalized for integrated luminosity such that, in
any region, the sum of the weights of events falling in the region is an unbiased estimate of the
expected number of events falling in the same region during a given fixed time interval. In our
case, the weights correspond to the quantity of real data taken during the year 2012. The weights
are an artifact of the way the simulation works and so they are not part of the input to the classifier.
For the Challenge, weights have been provided in the training set so the AMS can be
properly evaluated. Weights were not provided it in the qualifying set since the weight distribution
of the signal and background sets are very different and so they would give away the label
immediately. However, in the opendata.cern.ch dataset, weights and labels have been provided
for the complete dataset.</subfield>

<subfield code="a">The Higgs boson machine learning challenge (HiggsML or Challenge in short) has been set up to promote collaboration between high energy physicists and data scientists. The ATLAS experiment at CERN provided simulated data used by physicists to optimize the analysis of the Higgs boson. The Challenge is organized by a small group of ATLAS physicists and data scientists. It is hosted by Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson. This document provides technical background for the Challenge; reading and understanding it is not necessary to participate in the Challenge, but it is probably useful. No prior knowledge of high energy physics is required. All information on how to participate in the Challenge is available on the Kaggle web site.</subfield>
