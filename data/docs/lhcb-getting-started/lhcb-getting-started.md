By the end of 2023, LHCb released all of its Run I data, via CERN Open Data Portal, to the general public. The data comes in `.DST` and `.MDST` format which is the same format used by LHCb internally.

- Every data set released is narrated by an "Open Data Record" accessible through Open Data Portal.
- Open Data Records contain various bits of information about the selected data set (this is called metadata). An example of the types of metadata provided in the record is:
    - Number of events in the dataset
    - Number of files in the dataset
    - Combined size in TB of the dataset
    - Production ID
    - Production Type
    - Detector conditions (condb, dddb tags)
    - List of Trigger Configuration Keys (TCKs)
    - Scripts used for each production step
    - List of Logical File Names (LFNs) on [LHCb DIRAC](https://lhcb-dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The [LHCb Open Data Guide](https://lhcb-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/) and the metadata provided on the Open Data Portal should help the user to navigate, select, and work with LHCb Open Data.
