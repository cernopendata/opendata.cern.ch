Today, the CMS Collaboration at CERN has released more than [300 terabytes (TB) of high-quality open data](/search?page=1&size=20&q=Run2011A%20AND%20CMS-Primary-Datasets%20OR%20CMS-Simulated-Datasets%20OR%20CMS-Derived-Datasets). These include over 100 TB, or 2.5 inverse femtobarns (fb−1), of data from proton collisions at 7 TeV, making up half the data collected at the LHC by the CMS detector in 2011. This follows a previous release from November 2014, which made available around 27 TB of research data collected in 2010.

Available on the CERN Open Data Portal — which is built in collaboration with members of CERN’s IT Department and Scientific Information Service — the collision data are released into the public domain under the CC0 waiver and come in types: The so-called "[primary datasets](/search?page=1&size=20&q=Run2011A%20AND%20CMS-Primary-Datasets)" are in the same format used by the CMS Collaboration to perform research. The "[derived datasets](/search?page=1&size=20&q=Run2011A%20AND%20CMS-Derived-Datasets)" on the other hand require a lot less computing power and can be readily analysed by university or high-school students, and CMS has provided a limited number of datasets in this format.
