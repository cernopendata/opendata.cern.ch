The Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment is one of the four big experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In contrast to its siblings, LHCb is an asymmetric detector that covers events at forward rapidities ($2<\eta<5$). The spirit behind this particular design is to exploit the large production of heavy-flavour quarks in the forward rapidity region.

The **main goal** of LHCb is to study sources of CP violation, via rare decays of *B* (beauty) and *D* mesons, in order to explain the current asymmetry of matter-antimatter in the universe.
