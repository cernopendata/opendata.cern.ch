The Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment is one of the four big
experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In contrast to its siblings,
LHCb is an asymmetric detector that covers events at forward rapidities
($2<\eta<5$). The spirit behind this particular design is to exploit the large
production of heavy-flavour quarks in the forward rapidity region.

The main goal of LHCb is to study sources of CP violation, via rare decays of
beauty and charmed hadrons, in order to explain the current asymmetry of
matter-antimatter in the universe. However, LHCb is a versatile detector
enabling the study of a broad range of physical phenomena - including
spectroscopy studies of conventional and exotic hadrons, and searches for
extremely rare processes.

The [Getting Started with LHCb Open Data](/docs/lhcb-getting-started)
page contains information on the available open data from the LHCb
experiment to explore!

The [LHCb Open Data Guide](https://lhcb-opendata-guide.web.cern.ch/) contains
information about:

- Analysis of [Run 1 $pp$
  data](/search?q=&f=experiment%3ALHCb&f=type%3ADataset%2Bsubtype%3ACollision&f=file_type%3ADST&f=file_type%3AMDST&l=list&order=desc&p=1&s=10&sort=mostrecent)
  found on the CERN Open Data portal.
- Usage of the [LHCb Ntupling
  Service](https://opendata-lhcb-ntupling-service.app.cern.ch/) for exploration
  of both Run 1 and Run 2 $pp$ data.
