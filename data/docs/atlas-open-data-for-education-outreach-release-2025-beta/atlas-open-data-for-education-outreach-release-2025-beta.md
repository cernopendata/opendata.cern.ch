**A major update for the 13 TeV ATLAS Education and Outreach Open Data**

The ATLAS Collaboration has just launched a new release of open data designed
to empower education, outreach and citizen science. Building on a commitment to
open access, the new 2025 Open Data for Education and Outreach (beta) release
offers a significant upgrade in usability, scale and technical support.

This release simplifies and expands on previous open data releases with a
dedicated, open-source framework, now publicly available, alongside enhanced
tools and documentation. It includes:

- Guided workbooks and code to help users analyse real LHC collision data
- Modules to build computing skills, perfect for students and independent
  learners
- Support for educators to create custom courses and projects using real LHC
  data

If you’ve used ATLAS Open Data before – this is also a big refresh. With
increased statistical power and updated tools, you can pursue all-new physics
analyses and revisit previous ones with enhanced precision.

So whether you’re a student, teacher, citizen scientist or just curious about
the Universe – dive into ATLAS Open Data for Education. Explore real LHC
collisions, develop valuable computing skills and uncover the properties of
fundamental particles for yourself.

The data are all available now on the [CERN Open Data Portal](/record/93910).
You can also [explore the documentation of the new
release](https://opendata.atlas.cern/docs/data/for_education/13TeV25_details)
or [visit the ATLAS Open Data Portal](https://opendata.atlas.cern) for more. We
will be building on this beta release with additional data selections,
analyses, and tools that will all be arriving soon!
