It is part of the datasets produced for the CMS open data workshop tutorials, and not all events in the parent dataset were necessarily processed.</p> <p>It is provided in two different structures: a collection of root files as a direct output of POET (separate trees for each object), and \"_flat.root\" files \"flattened\" to a single tree, as required when used in columnar analysis with e.g. <a href=\"https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/\">awkward array</a> and <a href=\"https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\">uproot</a>. RunIIFall15MiniAODv2_ZZ_TuneCUETP8M1_13TeV-pythia8_flat.root has the separate \"_flat.root\" files merged into one file. This dataset was derived from the primary dataset in MiniAOD format linked below.</p>\n"
